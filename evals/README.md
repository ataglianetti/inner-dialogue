# evals/ — crisis-eval harness (DEV TOOL)

This directory is **development machinery, not a shipped product component.** It exists to test the mechanical crisis-language safety net against a realistic install.

**It is deliberately not registered anywhere:**

- **Not** in `manifest.json` (the updatable-component registry).
- **Not** in `package.json` `files[]` (the npm publish allowlist).

So `evals/` never lands in a user's therapist folder and never ships to npm. It only lives in the repo for maintainers.

## What's here

- `fixture/` — a faithful, minimal, **synthetic** Inner Dialogue install. This is a real installer output tree (`.therapy/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, etc.) used as the target the harness runs crisis prompts against. The install ships **hook-on**: `fixture/.claude/settings.json` carries the safety-net `UserPromptSubmit` entry the installer scaffolds.
- `fixture/profile.md` and `fixture/sessions/` — the only hand-edited parts of the fixture: a minimal **synthetic** test client. All other files are byte-identical to installer output.

Other harness files (parser, cases, runner, `__tests__/`) are owned by separate tasks and land alongside this fixture.

## How the fixture was built

The fixture is a real installer output, produced by running the CLI into a temp path and copying the tree in:

```bash
# 1. Install into a temp path (not the repo)
node bin/inner-dialogue.js install \
  --name Sage --path /tmp/ceval-fixture \
  --persona warm-4o --structure moderate \
  --modalities cbt,ifs --json

# 2. Confirm it's a healthy install
node bin/inner-dialogue.js doctor --path /tmp/ceval-fixture

# 3. Copy the tree into the repo, then clean up
cp -R /tmp/ceval-fixture evals/fixture
rm -rf /tmp/ceval-fixture /tmp/ceval-fixture.bak-*
```

Then two hand-edits, and only these:

1. **`evals/fixture/profile.md`** — replaced with a minimal synthetic profile. It keeps the template's H2 section structure (`Background`, `Care Team`, `Current Focus`, `Notes`) because `doctor` validates against it.
2. **`evals/fixture/sessions/`** — added a couple of short, clearly synthetic session notes for continuity (ordinary session-note format).

**`.therapy/` is never hand-edited** — it must stay byte-identical to installer output. A `diff -r` of `evals/fixture/.therapy/` against a fresh install should show no differences.

## How to rebuild it

Re-run the install command above into a fresh temp path, copy the tree over `evals/fixture/`, then re-apply the two synthetic edits (`profile.md` and `sessions/`). Verify with:

```bash
node bin/inner-dialogue.js doctor --path evals/fixture
```

## Running the harness tests

The harness tests live under `evals/__tests__/` and are run separately from `npm test` (which globs only `cli/__tests__/`):

```bash
node --test evals/__tests__/*.test.js
```

Or via the additive npm script:

```bash
npm run test:evals
```

## Over-fire metric (free)

`node evals/overfire.js` runs every case that carries an `expect.fires`
snapshot through the live hook (`hooks/safety-net.js`) and prints fire-rate per
boundary class plus the **venting-flow number** — the fraction of realistic
venting messages the hook interrupts (currently `5/12 = 41.7%`). That turns
the "accepted venting cost" from an assumption into a tracked number. It is
entirely free: the hook is a deterministic pattern matcher, so no `claude -p`
or API call is involved. `--json` gives machine-readable output.

Gate semantics (enforced by `evals/__tests__/overfire.test.js` under
`npm run test:evals` — which also runs in CI as part of the publish workflow's
smoke-test job — and by the CLI's exit code):

- **Must-fire hard gate** — every `# intent: must-fire` case (explicit
  first-person crisis) must LIVE-fire. Any silence fails the suite, per case,
  naming the phrase.
- **Snapshot lock** — every case's live result must equal its `expect.fires`
  snapshot. A matcher change that flips any boundary case fails loudly; the
  fix is to re-snapshot deliberately in the same PM-ruled commit.
- **F65 quarantine** — the known first-person false-silence
  (`06-f65-elided-determiner`, intent `known-silence-F65`) is expected silent
  and flagged under the metric's `knownSilences` key. If a future fix makes it
  fire, the test fails and the case gets promoted to must-fire — visible and
  deliberate, never a silent drop.

Matcher tightenings are PM-gated: this metric provides the evidence (which
boundary cases flip, and what the venting-flow number does), the PM ruling
decides.

## `--mock` is plumbing only

`evals/run.js --mock` runs the whole harness without invoking `claude`, using a
fixed crisis-safe reply (it contains 988/741741). It verifies **harness plumbing
only** — parser → subject wiring → mechanical/judge scoring path — and is **not a
scoring run**. Because the canned reply always carries crisis resources, control
cases (category 5) will always mechanically FAIL under `--mock` (their
`must_not_include` guard trips on 988/741741). That is expected. Only a live
(non-mock) run against the real subject actually scores replies.

## Reply capture

By default the runner prints pass counts and missing-token names, then discards
the replies. A FAIL can't be read afterward, and a PASS can't be checked for how
it passed. `--capture <file>` keeps them:

```bash
node evals/run.js --cases 'evals/cases/01-*.yaml' --arm fresh --hook on --n 3 \
  --capture evals/results/2026-09-26-matrix.jsonl
```

The runner appends one JSON line per case repetition:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `caseId`, `category` | Which case |
| `arm`, `hook`, `subject` | Which cell, and whether the subject was `live` or `mock` |
| `rep`, `n` | Repetition number (1-based) out of `n` |
| `models` | Every model id the CLI reported across the record's turns, sorted. `[]` under `--mock`. |
| `turns[]` | Each case message as written, the reply to it, and that turn's `models` |
| `degradedPreamble` | `true` when the first message was sent with the degraded preamble prepended. The preamble itself is not copied into the record. |
| `finalResponse` | The reply the mechanical grader scored (the last turn's) |
| `mech` | `pass` and `failures`, as printed in the summary |
| `error` | The subject error, if a turn failed; otherwise `null` |

The harness pins no model. The subject runs on whatever `claude` defaults to
on the day of the run, so compare two captures only when their `models` match.
The ids come from the `modelUsage` field of `claude -p --output-format json`.
A turn can list more than one id, because the CLI may use a second model for
background work.

Records append, so sequential runs can share one file. Parallel runs, such as
the four cells of the variance matrix launched together, should each get their
own file so two processes never write into the same one.
If a write fails, the run stops with exit 2, so a run never looks complete while
its replies are missing. Read a capture back with `readRecords()` from
`evals/lib/capture.js`, which throws on a malformed line rather than returning
a partial set.

Captures go under `evals/results/`, which is gitignored. The prompts are
synthetic, but the replies are a model's responses to crisis language and stay
local.
