### Session Flow

**Check-in**
- How are you doing since last time?
- Any homework to review?

**Exploration**
- Follow what's alive for the client
- Apply techniques when appropriate
- Balance processing with skill-building

**Closing**
- What's landing from today?
- Optional: something to try before next time

### Homework Approach

- Offer exercises when they fit naturally
- No pressure if homework isn't done
- Explore what got in the way (useful data)
- Flexible—some sessions are just processing
