## Polyvagal-Informed Work

**Core principle:** Our nervous system constantly scans for safety and danger (neuroception), and our emotional and behavioral responses are shaped by which autonomic state we're in. Understanding the nervous system's states isn't just information—it's a map for self-regulation and healing.

### Three Autonomic States

**1. Ventral Vagal (Safe and Social)**
- Feeling safe, connected, present, and engaged
- Access to curiosity, play, creativity, and compassion
- Social engagement system is online: eye contact, vocal prosody, facial expression
- This is the state where healing, learning, and connection happen
- "I'm okay. You're okay. We're okay."

**2. Sympathetic (Fight or Flight)**
- Mobilization in response to perceived threat
- Anxiety, anger, panic, restlessness, agitation
- Heart racing, shallow breathing, muscle tension
- "Something is wrong. I need to act."
- Adaptive when danger is real; problematic when chronically activated

**3. Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown)**
- Immobilization in response to overwhelming threat
- Numbness, disconnection, collapse, dissociation, hopelessness
- Feeling frozen, foggy, flat, or "not here"
- "It's too much. I can't."
- The oldest survival response—playing dead

### Key Concepts

**Neuroception**
- The nervous system's unconscious detection of safety or danger
- Happens below awareness—we feel the shift before we understand it
- Can be faulty: detecting danger when safe, or missing real threats
- "Your nervous system decided before you did"

**The Autonomic Ladder**
- A way to visualize movement between states
- Top: Ventral vagal (safe, connected)
- Middle: Sympathetic (activated, mobilized)
- Bottom: Dorsal vagal (shut down, collapsed)
- People move up and down the ladder throughout the day
- Therapy helps build awareness of where you are and pathways back to ventral

**Glimmers**
- Small, micro-moments of ventral vagal activation
- A warm breeze, a kind voice, sunlight on skin, a pet's presence
- The opposite of triggers—cues of safety
- Noticing glimmers trains the nervous system to find its way back to safety

**Co-Regulation**
- Our nervous systems are designed to regulate together
- A calm presence can help settle an activated system
- This is why "just be there" is sometimes the most powerful intervention
- The therapeutic relationship itself is a co-regulation tool

### Key Questions

- "Where on the ladder do you feel like you are right now?"
- "What does your body feel like in this moment?"
- "What helps you find your way back to feeling safe and connected?"
- "When did you notice the shift happening?"
- "What are your glimmers—the small things that help you feel settled?"

### When to Use Polyvagal-Informed Work

- Chronic anxiety or hypervigilance
- Dissociation, numbness, or emotional shutdown
- Trauma responses (especially when they feel "irrational")
- Difficulty feeling safe in relationships
- Emotional dysregulation that feels body-based rather than thought-based
- Building a foundation for other therapeutic work
- Psychoeducation: helping people understand their own nervous system

### Vagal Toning Practices

- Soothing rhythm breathing with extended exhale
- Humming, singing, or chanting (stimulates the vagus nerve)
- Cold water on the face or wrists
- Orienting: slowly looking around the room, naming what you see
- Gentle movement: rocking, swaying, stretching
- Social engagement: safe eye contact, warm vocal tone, listening to music
