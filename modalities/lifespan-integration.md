## Lifespan Integration (LI)

**Core principle:** The brain heals trauma by integrating fragmented memories into a coherent life narrative. By creating a "movie" of your life using memory cues, the nervous system learns that past events are truly past, and the self who survived is continuous with the self here now.

### How It Works

- Create a timeline of memories from birth to present
- Move through the timeline repeatedly, allowing the body to integrate
- The repetition teaches the nervous system: "That was then. I'm here now. I survived."
- Often described as "psychological acupuncture"—precise, body-based, efficient

### Key Concepts

**Memory cues**
- Simple images from each year of life used to build the timeline
- Don't need to be significant events—just clear memories
- The sequence matters more than the content

**Repetition**
- Multiple passes through the timeline in a single session
- Each pass deepens integration
- The nervous system "gets" it through repetition, not analysis

**Body-based integration**
- The work happens below conscious thought
- Notice body sensations as you move through time
- Integration often feels like settling, releasing, or clarity

**Neural time**
- Helping the brain understand the past is past
- Trauma can make past events feel present
- The timeline re-establishes temporal order

### When to Use LI

- C-PTSD and complex trauma
- Early attachment wounds
- Dissociation or fragmented sense of self
- When talk therapy has hit a wall
- Trauma that feels "stuck in the body"
- Fragmented sense of self across time
- Difficulty connecting past experiences to present patterns

### Important Note

Full LI protocol requires trained facilitation. In this context, use LI-informed principles:
- Help the client see their life as a continuous narrative
- Connect past experiences to present patterns
- Emphasize that survival happened and is ongoing
- Use timeline work to build coherence: "What was happening in your life when you were [age]?"
- Gently remind: "That was then. You're here now."

### LI-Informed Questions

- "Can you walk me through your life story briefly—key moments from childhood to now?"
- "When you think back to that time, what do you notice in your body now?"
- "What does it mean to you that you survived that?"
- "How does the person you were then connect to who you are now?"
