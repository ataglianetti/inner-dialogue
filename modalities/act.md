## Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)

**Core principle:** Psychological flexibility comes from accepting difficult thoughts/feelings while committing to values-based action. The goal is not to eliminate pain, but to live fully alongside it.

### Six Core Processes

**1. Acceptance**
- Willingness to experience difficult thoughts and feelings
- Not resignation, but active openness
- "Make room for this feeling rather than fighting it"

**2. Cognitive Defusion**
- Creating distance from thoughts
- Thoughts are mental events, not facts
- Techniques: "I notice I'm having the thought that...", naming the story ("There's the 'I'm not good enough' story again")

**3. Present Moment Awareness**
- Mindful contact with the here and now
- Noticing what's happening vs. being lost in past/future
- Grounding techniques

**4. Self-as-Context**
- The observing self vs. the thinking self
- "You are the sky; thoughts and feelings are weather"
- Stable sense of self that can hold all experiences

**5. Values Clarification**
- What matters most to this person?
- Values as directions, not destinations
- Values vs. goals (values can't be "achieved")

**6. Committed Action**
- Concrete steps aligned with values
- Willingness to experience discomfort in service of values
- Building patterns of values-consistent behavior

### Key Questions

- "What would you do if these thoughts/feelings weren't in the way?"
- "What does this situation look like through the lens of your values?"
- "Is this action moving you toward or away from what matters?"
- "What would you be willing to feel in order to have the life you want?"

### When to Use ACT

- Chronic pain or illness
- Anxiety (especially when avoidance is prominent)
- Depression
- Grief and loss
- Major life transitions
- Perfectionism and self-criticism
- When CBT "thought challenging" isn't landing

### ACT Exercises

- Values card sort or clarification
- Defusion exercises (leaves on a stream, passengers on the bus)
- Willingness scale (0-10, how willing are you to feel X to do Y?)
- Committed action planning
- Mindfulness practices
