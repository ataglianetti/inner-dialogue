## Internal Family Systems (IFS)

**Core principle:** The mind is naturally multiple—everyone has sub-personalities or "parts," and each part has positive intent, even when its behavior is harmful. Healing happens when the Self (our core, undamaged essence) builds compassionate relationships with all parts.

### The System

**Parts** are sub-personalities that carry emotions, beliefs, and roles. They develop to protect us, especially from early pain. No part is bad—but parts can take on extreme roles when burdened.

**Self** is the core of a person—who they are beneath all protective layers. Self is always present, never damaged, and naturally possesses the 8 C's:
- Calm, Curiosity, Clarity, Compassion
- Confidence, Courage, Creativity, Connectedness

When someone is "in Self," they can relate to their parts with openness rather than reactivity.

### Three Types of Parts

**Exiles**
- Young, wounded parts carrying pain, shame, fear, or loneliness
- Often frozen in the past, in moments of overwhelm
- Other parts work hard to keep Exiles out of awareness

**Managers**
- Proactive protectors that try to prevent pain before it happens
- Strategies: people-pleasing, perfectionism, control, intellectualizing, caretaking
- Keep life structured and Exiles locked away

**Firefighters**
- Reactive protectors that activate when Exiles break through
- Strategies: numbing, bingeing, dissociation, rage, self-harm, substance use
- Emergency responders—they don't care about consequences, only stopping pain now

### Key Concepts

**Blending** — When a part's feelings or beliefs merge with the person's sense of self. "I am worthless" (blended) vs. "A part of me feels worthless" (unblended).

**Unblending** — Creating separation between Self and a part. The first step in all IFS work. Techniques: asking the part to "step back," noticing where the part lives in the body, asking "how do you feel toward this part?"

**Unburdening** — The healing process where an Exile releases the pain, beliefs, or sensations it has been carrying, often through imagery (releasing to wind, water, fire, earth, or light).

**Parts Mapping** — Identifying the parts involved in a pattern, their roles, and relationships to each other. Helps see the internal system as a whole.

### Key Questions

- "How do you feel toward that part?" (checks for Self-energy vs. another part responding)
- "What does this part want you to know?"
- "What is it afraid would happen if it stopped doing its job?"
- "How old does this part seem?"
- "Where do you notice this part in your body?"

### When to Use IFS

- Inner conflict ("Part of me wants X, but another part...")
- Self-criticism and shame cycles
- Patterns that resist change despite insight
- Trauma work (with care and pacing)
- Emotional overwhelm or numbness
- Relationship difficulties driven by protective parts
- Addictive or compulsive behaviors

### IFS Exercises

- Parts mapping or journaling (who shows up around this issue?)
- "Getting to know" a part: approaching with curiosity, asking what it needs
- Noticing blending in real time: "Is that me or a part?"
- Self-energy check-in: "How much Self do I have access to right now?"
- Guided unburdening visualization (only when parts are ready)
