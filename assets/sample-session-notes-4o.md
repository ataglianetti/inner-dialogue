# Session: January 15, 2025

## Key Themes
- work stress, too many deadlines, saying yes to everything
- fear that setting boundaries = being seen as "not a team player"
- worth tied to productivity (where did that come from?)

## Emotional State
- exhausted, running on fumes
- anxious when we talked about actually saying no
- some relief when we named the pattern

## Patterns Noted
- people-pleasing, taking on too much
- self-worth = how much they can handle
- probably learned this early (explore next time)

## Threads to Revisit
- where did "worth = capacity" come from?
- try one small boundary this week - even tiny counts
