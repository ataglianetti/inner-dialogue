## Terminal Session View

```
You: I've been feeling overwhelmed at work lately. Too many deadlines,
     not enough time, and I keep saying yes to things I shouldn't.

Sage: That sounds exhausting - carrying more than you have capacity for,
      and feeling like you can't say no. What happens when you imagine
      setting a boundary with someone at work?

You: Honestly? Anxiety. Like they'll think I'm not a team player or
     that I can't handle my job.

Sage: So there's a fear underneath - that saying no means something
      negative about you. "Not a team player" or "can't handle it."

      I'm curious: where did you first learn that your worth was tied
      to how much you could take on?
